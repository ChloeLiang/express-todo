Create a todo list app for yourself.

Use express, jsonfile and react templates as we have been doing during the week.

You should be able to:
- see every item in your todo list (GET)
- add an item to the list - this will have the text of the thing you need to accomplish (POST)
- mark it as done (PUT)

#### Getting Started
Install all of the libraries you will need in your app.

```
express
jsonfile
method-override
express-react-views
react
react-dom
```

Your app is a todo *list*. Therefore the data structure that holds each list item should be an array. This setup should mirror the one for pokemon. (Which is an object with a list of pokemon inside it).

Once you have a json file then you must begin with the first logical user action- to add something to the list. (Don't begin with getting things from the list- since it will be empty at the start)

Begin this *adding* functionality with the first thing the user needs to see or do for this flow- which is load an HTML form.

#### Optional
If you want you can choose to make a shopping list app instead.
